Upgrade packages with confidence

## Introduction

This project aims to make package upgrades, specifically npm packages, easier to deal with. The goal is to provide a concise list of things you need to be aware of when upgrading any package that posts release notes to its Github "releases" page. More sources will be added as they come up.

## Tests

I've started writing rudimentary tests in the `test` directory. You can run `npm test` to run them.

## Note

This project is under active development as a brand new package and is in extreme flux. Stay tuned for more!
